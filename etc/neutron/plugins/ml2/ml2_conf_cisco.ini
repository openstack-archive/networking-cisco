# (BoolOpt) A flag to enable strict hostkey checks when connecting to
# Nexus switches. Defaults to False (No hostkey checks)
# This will be deprecated along with nexus_driver since this is
# associated to the ncclient driver which is going away.
# host_key_checks = False

# (ListOp) A choice of driver methods to configure Nexus devices.
# The default choice has changed to 'restapi' which replaces the
# original 'ncclient' driver.  The RESTAPI driver has better
# performance with less Nexus session limits.  Additionally,
# new feature development is applied only to restapi driver.
# Plans are to remove ncclient driver in Cisco 7.0.0 release.
# To use the restapi driver, the Nexus 9K image version must be
# 7.0(3)I5(2) or greater.  For short term, the original driver can be
# used by setting the nexus_driver to 'ncclient'.  The default is
# set to:
# nexus_driver = restapi

#
# (StrOpt) The name of the physical_network managed via the Cisco Nexus Switch.
# This string value must be present in the ml2_conf.ini network_vlan_ranges
# variable.
#
# managed_physical_network =
# Example: managed_physical_network = physnet1

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether OpenStack networking should manage the
# creation and removal of VLANs for provider networks on the Nexus
# switches. If the flag is set to False then OpenStack will not create or
# remove VLANs for provider networks, and the administrator needs to
# manage these interfaces manually or by external orchestration.
#
# provider_vlan_auto_create = True

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether OpenStack networking should manage
# the adding and removing of provider VLANs from trunk ports on the Nexus
# switches. If the flag is set to False then OpenStack will not add or
# remove provider VLANs from trunk ports, and the administrator needs to
# manage these operations manually or by external orchestration.
#
# provider_vlan_auto_trunk = True

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether OpenStack networking should manage the
# creating and removing of the Nexus switch VXLAN global settings of 'feature
# nv overlay', 'feature vn-segment-vlan-based', 'interface nve 1' and the NVE
# subcommand 'source-interface loopback #'. If the flag is set to False
# (default) then OpenStack will not add or remove these VXLAN settings, and
# the administrator needs to manage these operations manually or by  external
# orchestration.
#
# vxlan_global_config = True

# (BoolOpt) To make Nexus device persistent by running the Nexus
# CLI 'copy run start' after applying successful configurations.
# (default) This flag defaults to False keep consistent with
# existing functionality.
# This will be deprecated along with nexus_driver since this is
# associated to the ncclient driver which is going away.
#
# persistent_switch_config = False

# (BoolOpt) Prevent caching ssh connections to a Nexus switch.
# Set this to True when there are multiple neutron controllers
# and/or when there may be non-neutron ssh connections to the
# same Nexus device. Nexus devices have a limit of 8 such
# connections. When a single neutron controller has more than
# 8 processes, caching is automatically disabled without
# regard to this option.
# (default) This flag defaults to False which indicates that ssh
# connections to a Nexus switch are cached when the neutron
# controller has fewer than 8 processes.
# This will be deprecated along with nexus_driver since this is
# associated to the ncclient driver which is going away.
#
# never_cache_ssh_connection = False

# (IntOpt) Time interval to check the state of the Nexus device.
# (default) This value defaults to 30 seconds which enables this
# functionality.  To disable config replay, set to 0 seconds.
#
# switch_heartbeat_time = 30

#
# (1) For each host connected to a port on the switch, specify the hostname
#     and the Nexus physical port (interface) it is connected to.
#     Valid intf_type's are 'ethernet' and 'port-channel'.
#     The default setting for <intf_type:> is 'ethernet' and need not be
#     added to this setting.
# (2) The TCP port for connecting via SSH to manage the switch. This is
#     port number 22 unless the switch has been configured otherwise.
# (3) The username for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (4) The password for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (5) Only valid if VXLAN overlay is configured and vxlan_global_config is
#     set to True.
#     The NVE source interface is a loopback interface that is configured on
#     the switch with valid /32 IP address. This /32 IP address must be known
#     by the transient devices in the transport network and the remote VTEPs.
#     This is accomplished by advertising it through a dynamic routing protocol
#     in the transport network. (NB: If no nve_src_intf is defined then a
#     default setting of 0 (creates "loopback0") will be used.)
# (6) Only valid if VXLAN overlay is configured.
#     The physical network name defined in the network_vlan_ranges variable
#     (defined under the ml2_type_vlan section) that this switch is controlling.
#     The configured 'physnet' is the physical network domain that is connected
#     to this switch. The vlan ranges defined in network_vlan_ranges for a
#     a physical network are allocated dynamically and are unique per physical
#     network. These dynamic vlans may be reused across physical networks.
# (7) VPC pool is valid for baremetal configurations only.
#     When there is a list of ethernet interfaces provided by Ironic to neutron
#     in a port binding event, these are assumed to be a port-channel type
#     configuration.  Ironic only knows about ethernet interfaces so it is up
#     to the Nexus ML2 Driver to either learn the port channel if the user
#     preconfigured the channel-group on the ethernet interfaces otherwise
#     the driver will create a new port-channel and apply the channel-group
#     to the ethernet interfaces.  This pool is the reserved port-channel IDs
#     available for allocation by the Nexus ML2 driver for each switch.  The
#     format <start-end,number> allows you to configure a range from
#     start to end as well as individual numbers.  There can be
#     any number of ranges and numbers separated by commas. There is no
#     default value.  If not configured, the port-channel will only handle
#     learned cases and attempts to create port-channels will fail since
#     there is no id pool available from which to get an id.
#     Once defined, it can be redefined by changing the variable and
#     restarting neutron. Existing VPC ids in the database
#     are gathered and compared against the new vpc_pool config.
#     New configured vpcids not found in the database are added.
#     Inactive entries in the database not found in the configured
#     vpcids list are removed.
# (8) intfcfg_portchannel is valid for baremetal configurations only.
#     When there are multiple interfaces in a baremetal event, the
#     nexus driver checks to determine whether a port channel is already applied
#     to the interfaces; otherwise, it creates a port channel.  The
#     optional configuration 'intfcfg_portchannel' allows the administrator
#     to custom configure the port-channel.  Any number of Nexus port-channel
#     commands separated by ';' can be provided.  When this option is not
#     configured, the nexus driver defaults to configuring
#     'spanning-tree port type edge trunk;no lacp suspend-individual'
#     beneath the port-channel.
#
# Example:
# [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:1.1.1.1]
# compute1=1/1
# compute2=ethernet:1/2
# compute3=port-channel:1
# ssh_port=22
# username=admin
# password=mySecretPassword
# nve_src_intf=1
# physnet=physnet1
# vpc_pool=1001-1025,1028
# intfcfg_portchannel=no lacp suspend-individual;spanning-tree port type edge trunk
