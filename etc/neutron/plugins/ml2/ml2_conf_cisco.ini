# (StrOpt) A short prefix to prepend to the VLAN number when creating a
# VLAN interface. For example, if an interface is being created for
# VLAN 2001 it will be named 'q-2001' using the default prefix.
# The total length allowed for the prefix name and VLAN is 32 characters,
# the prefix will be truncated if the total length is greater than 32.
#
# vlan_name_prefix = q-
# Example: vlan_name_prefix = vnet-

# (BoolOpt) A flag to enable round robin scheduling of routers for SVI.
# svi_round_robin = False

# (BoolOpt) A flag to enable strict hostkey checks when connecting to
# Nexus switches. Defaults to False (No hostkey checks)
# host_key_checks = False

# (ListOp) A choice of drivers to configure Nexus devices.  The
# default choice is 'ncclient' which was the original driver
# until rest api driver was developed. To choose the
# rest api driver, set nexus_driver to 'restapi' which
# has better performance and no Nexus session limits.
# This option should only be selected if you have a
# Nexus 9K image version 7.0(3)I5(2) or greater.
# nexus_driver = ncclient

#
# (StrOpt) The name of the physical_network managed via the Cisco Nexus Switch.
# This string value must be present in the ml2_conf.ini network_vlan_ranges
# variable.
#
# managed_physical_network =
# Example: managed_physical_network = physnet1

# Cisco Nexus Switch configurations.
# Each switch to be managed by OpenStack Neutron must be configured here.
#
# Cisco Nexus Switch Format.
# [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:<IP address of switch>]
# <hostname>=<intf_type:port>       (1)
# ssh_port=<ssh port>               (2)

#
# (1) For each host connected to a port on the switch, specify the hostname
#     and the Nexus physical port (interface) it is connected to.
#     Valid intf_type's are 'ethernet' and 'port-channel'.
#     The default setting for <intf_type:> is 'ethernet' and need not be
#     added to this setting.
# (2) The TCP port for connecting via SSH to manage the switch. This is
#     port number 22 unless the switch has been configured otherwise.
# (3) The username for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (4) The password for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (5) Only valid if VXLAN overlay is configured and vxlan_global_config is
#     set to True.
#     The NVE source interface is a loopback interface that is configured on
#     the switch with valid /32 IP address. This /32 IP address must be known
#     by the transient devices in the transport network and the remote VTEPs.
#     This is accomplished by advertising it through a dynamic routing protocol
#     in the transport network. (NB: If no nve_src_intf is defined then a
#     default setting of 0 (creates "loopback0") will be used.)
# (6) Only valid if VXLAN overlay is configured.
#     The physical network name defined in the network_vlan_ranges variable
#     (defined under the ml2_type_vlan section) that this switch is controlling.
#     The configured 'physnet' is the physical network domain that is connected
#     to this switch. The vlan ranges defined in network_vlan_ranges for a
#     a physical network are allocated dynamically and are unique per physical
#     network. These dynamic vlans may be reused across physical networks.
# (7) VPC pool is valid for Baremetal configurations.
#     When there is a list of ethernet interfaces provided by Ironic to neutron
#     in a port binding transaction, these are assumed to be port-channel type
#     configurations.  Ironic only learns ethernet interfaces so it is up to
#     the Nexus ML2 Driver to either learn the port channel if the channel-group
#     is already applied to the ethernet interfaces OR create a new port-channel
#     and apply the channel-group to the ethernet interface.  This pool is the 
#     reserved port-channel IDs available for allocation by the Nexus ML2 driver
#     for each switch.  Existing port-channel interfaces preconfigured on
#     ethernet interfaces in use will be reused by the driver.
#

# [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:1.1.1.1]
# compute1=1/1
# compute2=ethernet:1/2

# nve_src_intf=1

# vpc_pool=1001,1025

# (StrOpt) A short prefix to prepend to the VLAN number when creating a
# provider VLAN interface. For example, if an interface is being created
# for provider VLAN 3003 it will be named 'p-3003' using the default prefix.
# The total length allowed for the prefix name and VLAN is 32 characters,
# the prefix will be truncated if the total length is greater than 32.

# provider_vlan_name_prefix = p-
# Example: provider_vlan_name_prefix = PV-

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether OpenStack networking should manage the
# creation and removal of VLANs for provider networks on the Nexus
# switches. If the flag is set to False then OpenStack will not create or
# remove VLANs for provider networks, and the administrator needs to
# manage these interfaces manually or by external orchestration.

# provider_vlan_auto_create = True

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether OpenStack networking should manage
# the adding and removing of provider VLANs from trunk ports on the Nexus
# switches. If the flag is set to False then OpenStack will not add or
# remove provider VLANs from trunk ports, and the administrator needs to
# manage these operations manually or by external orchestration.
#
# provider_vlan_auto_trunk = True

# (BoolOpt) A flag indicating whether OpenStack networking should manage the
# creating and removing of the Nexus switch VXLAN global settings of 'feature
# nv overlay', 'feature vn-segment-vlan-based', 'interface nve 1' and the NVE
# subcommand 'source-interface loopback #'. If the flag is set to False
# (default) then OpenStack will not add or remove these VXLAN settings, and
# the administrator needs to manage these operations manually or by  external
# orchestration.
#
# vxlan_global_config = True

# (BoolOpt) To make Nexus device persistent by running the Nexus
# CLI 'copy run start' after applying successful configurations.
# (default) This flag defaults to False keep consistent with
# existing functionality.
#
# persistent_switch_config = False

# (BoolOpt) Prevent caching ssh connections to a Nexus switch.
# Set this to True when there are multiple neutron controllers
# and/or when there may be non-neutron ssh connections to the
# same Nexus device. Nexus devices have a limit of 8 such
# connections. When a single neutron controller has more than
# 8 processes, caching is automatically disabled without
# regard to this option.
# (default) This flag defaults to False which indicates that ssh
# connections to a Nexus switch are cached when the neutron
# controller has fewer than 8 processes.
#
# never_cache_ssh_connection = False

# (IntOpt) Time interval to check the state of the Nexus device.
# (default) This value defaults to 0 seconds which disables this
# functionality.  When enabled, 30 seconds is suggested.

# switch_heartbeat_time = 0
